Sequence 1.0.0.0
=====================

Intro
-----
The Sequence(SEQ) blockchain exists in the Duality binary architecture as an asset and in turn for [Dynamic(DYN)](https://github.com/duality-solutions/dynamic) is its real world interface.

Sequence is a digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Sequence uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority (centralisation): managing transactions and issuing currency (SEQ) are carried out collectively by the Sequence network. Sequence is the name of open source software which enables the use of the currency SEQ.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run sequence-qt.exe.

Sequence is the original Sequence client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Sequence transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
